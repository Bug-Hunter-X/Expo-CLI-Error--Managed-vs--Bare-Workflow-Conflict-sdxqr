The solution depends entirely on the context of the error. If you're getting this error, you've likely attempted to use a managed workflow feature in a bare workflow project. To resolve this, you will need to ensure that your project is correctly configured either as a managed or a bare workflow project.  Avoid mixing features from both workflows. If you need to use a feature exclusive to managed workflow, start a new managed workflow project.  Similarly, if you are working with a bare workflow project, you must implement the necessary functionality manually or use a compatible library that supports bare workflows.   Check your `package.json` file for the Expo packages.  If you want a managed workflow project, ensure the `expo` package is correctly set up and that you avoid using features or commands that are only relevant to a bare workflow.
