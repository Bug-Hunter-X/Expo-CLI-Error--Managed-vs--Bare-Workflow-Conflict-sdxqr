# Expo CLI Error: Managed vs. Bare Workflow Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose error in the Expo CLI, arising from a mismatch between the expected workflow (managed or bare) and the actual project setup.  The error messages are often vague, making identification challenging.

## Bug Description

Attempting to use a managed workflow feature within a bare workflow project, or vice-versa, results in obscure errors.  This is because the underlying project structures and build processes differ significantly.

## Reproduction

The `expoBareWorkflowBug.js` file contains code that attempts to utilize a managed workflow function in a bare workflow context, illustrating the problem.

## Solution

The `expoBareWorkflowSolution.js` file offers a corrected approach, ensuring consistency between the chosen workflow and project configuration.
